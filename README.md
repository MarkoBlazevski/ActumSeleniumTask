# ActumSeleniumTask

This project is ment to be my solution for the task that I've got.
I've used C#, Selenium and NUnit to solve this task.

In order to use this project you need to pull it to you local machine and open it in your favorite IDE(mine is VS :smiley:)
Run test cases from Test explorer or from terminal.
For running tests from terminal first you need to navigate to project root.

Terminal commands:

To run test cases with specific test tag use this command
:point_right:
dotnet test "ProjectName" --filter TestCategory=TagName

To run all tests 
:point_right:
dotnet test --filter Name~TestName

Enjoy!
